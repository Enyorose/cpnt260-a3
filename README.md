## Problems I experienced 
- I had some problems with the margins around each of the figures, although i learned in class about setting a reset in CSS that fixed the problem.
- The other issue I had was with sticking my footer to the bottom of my page, I was able to figure that out with a little help from fesal he suggested making my main into 100vh and setting my footers position to relative then maneuvering it to the bottom of the page.
- I was also having trouble with using a fonts.css so I copied it all into my styles.css and used the comment out syntax to make easy to read sections in hoping to keep my code cleaner.
